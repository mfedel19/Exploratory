I've tried to determine if i scoped the project properly and provided enough direction for the team but again, the Butler teams didn't even meet with us in creating their reports and five years later, i still occasionally refer back to them -they are that good.  The lack of an academic advisor or support to the 180DC team might account for some of the difference.  The lack of credits associated with the 180DC project might also be a factor, but our last BU group produced (in the same time period) about 30,000 words with strongly reasoned suggestions for ideas that were in many cases quite creative or at least supported by research.  By contrast this report was thin and at least one section of the report left me with the impression that one member of the team had done little if any real thinking about the issue.  I've avoided letting that section draw down the overall scores out of respect for the team members who did engage in deeper thought and generated useful ideas.

I finally found six or seven 180DC consultants sitting with the door closed in a meeting room.

So my tip would be when you have a meeting with a client who is coming to an office they are unfamiliar with, keep the meeting door open (particularly if there are no windows to see in) and stand up and introduce yourself - shake hands etc.

Die Projektergebnisse stellen Meilensteine fÃ¼r SOS Kinderdorf dar, auf welche in der Zukunft aufgebaut werden kÃ¶nnen.
Durch die strukturierte Analyse der bestehenden Daten konnten die wesentlichen Einflussfaktoren der Kosten bzw.  Einkommen systematisch identifiziert und somit das Fundament fÃ¼r die zukÃ¼nftige Abweichungsanalyse bei SOS Kinderdorf geschaffen werden.
Das von 180DC geschaffene Instrument wird ein zentrales Hilfsmittel fÃ¼r die zukÃ¼nftige Steuerung innerhalb der unterschiedlichen Ebenen der weltweiten Organisation und wird uns helfen, die bestehenden Ressourcen bestmÃ¶glich einzusetzen.

","If time and capacity allowed, it would have been useful to have the evaluation tools specified to include ones that have been shown to be useful with children from CALD (Culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds) and to have the team come out to various programs (Circus, Active Kids, Parent programs etc.) to make recommendations about suitable evaluation tools per program and perhaps even have a case study of a similar community development program that has an evidence base.

The 2nd area of the report of increasing demand for our sessions in terms 1 and 4 was also potentially not accessing expertise beyond what we already have. There are some fresh ideas that have come from the outside perspective which I might refer back to in the future. The advice of increasing our social media and blog presence included some helpful statistics and research, however would require a staffing increase, and as we are short staffed already will not happen. It also has no direct connection to income, or at least that is very hard to measure, so would be very hard to convince the board to approve a staffing increase for. We also have absolutely zero idea if any of Youth and Schools CUSTOMERS are connected with our social media. Instead I have been focussing on partnerships with schools, and spending time learning about the pains experienced by teachers in Term 1 and 4, and the gains they are looking for. We will be responding with sessions tailored to these pains and gains.

It was a tangible action that they could mention to our board members that we were doing.  It was also reassuring to me that this was proceeding while I also worked to improve our strategy, as I knew that if I failed to come up with any new ideas, there was a team of people working on the same problems. In the end I did come up with some ideas, and did not need to seek more support from the 180 team. Initially I found it helpful to meet with the team, to talk out some of Urban Seed's issues and bounce ideas around a little bit. All brainstorming is beneficial. I could tell in that meeting though that I was expressing concepts and problems with fundraising that many in the team had likely not had to consider before. I think if I had included them in my thought processes over the next few months with updates of my own ideas, I would have empowered them to have more targeted thinking.

- We found the presentation really inspiring because we could see the amount of effort the team put in, and some really valuable ideas that are definitely actionable

- The analytics about FB were quite technical but presented to us in a really understandable and easy to implement way","- more professional in terms of contacting us (e.g. we were contacted through FB messenger, whereas email would be much more preferable), and also on the final presentation day (the location had to be moved, someone coming in late)
- team could be more cohesive (one person didnt end up coming and the other members didnt know her content). it was kind of clear that each project member did their own parts and didn't really get the big picture as a team.
- case studies were really helpful as a reference point, however I think it could have been more specific.
- would be good to outline assumptions (e.g. tutors are all uni students, post engagement means action is done)
- when defining the deliverables, would have been good to define limitations by the project leader instead of just letting us know they can help with everything, resulting in quite a broad interim report.
- case studies were good, but could have been improved if you actually validated your ideas with surveys with the target groups
- some advice was generic (e.g. golden ratio stuff could be googled), could have been improved by really honing down on what is relevant for us",4,"- Facebook - the 3 ""A""s was a really good initiative to fall back on, also the ""why factor"" and less diversity were all really good aspects.

Excellent (9-10),English,Competitor Analysis,Accomodation/Shelter,7/8/2017 20:34,10,4,4,4,4,The final SROI Methodology and the implementation tool - priceless.,"Six things.  1. The survey part of the presentation and research was a lost opportunity.  I had asked a number of times (around 3) for the team to go through the process and sign up to a course to experience the students' journey and they didn't do this.  What this resulted in was the survey part of the presentation showing the log-on screen not the sign-up screen and the recommendations that were presented on this basis were of no value.  2. I also felt that the team lacked knowledge about the users (volunteers and staff of nfps). I didn't realise this until our first meeting and let them know some things about the fact that they give up nights and weekends and paid days at work. As they themselves are doing this - in escense skilled volunteering - they didn't seem to understand this well.  I would have thought that they could have undertaken some research to understand the personas of nfp volunteers and staff prior to trying to work out the difference it makes to them.  3. This would have also helped the survey recommendations as some of the recommendations were not realistic - the survey that was shown and the questions that were expected to be asked of a new student were intrusive - e.g. income levels.  No-one likes giving personal information and with volunteers 35+ there is a lot of distrust about giving up their information online.  I felt this should have been incorporated into the survey recommendations - e.g. these two questions ask on sign-up (interests etc.) these five questions ask after 6 months etc. or these questions ask with a defined user group of x% market sample size if they have given permission to engage in the SROI research.  4. I also felt that some things were hard in the beginning re: data.  As a new organisation I made it clear that we didn't have a lot of data and we were waiting on this project before we determined what data we needed to start gathering and it was difficult for both parties.  Also the team had to wait a few extra days/to a week for me to go and try and create some data for them as we had none.  I also felt some of the data requests were odd - the number of website visitors, for example, were inconsistent with the project scope. 5. I was so disheartened when after being offered an implementation tool, they didn't deliver this at the presentation and I felt bad for asking for it even after I made it clear I was only asking because I was told I'd get it.  I then felt bad for them to have them work all weekend on it.  For me this raises a bigger issue for future teams in terms of offering things and understanding the impact of what they are offering and also that I do feel there should be a focus on delivering future clients with implementable tools - they won't expect them to be 100% but to have a model etc. that they can start using is the most valuable thing because a client hasn't done the work they have done and won't understand the particular elements they do.  I know, even though I can build excel models myself that this would have taken me about a week to do this tool and It would not have been as robust and simple to use as the tool they presented. 6. Lastly, I felt that the team could have 'checked-in' more with me about things. I made myself available for any questions at any time, and I recognise that they had a mentor and worked independently, however if they have of checked in with me on some things, particularly in the last half of the project when they were drawing a lot of conclusions based on their assumptions I could have steered them away from many of the issues that have occurred as above and this is reflected as in between the presentation and the tool deliverables, my feedback was considered and the measures of income were modified accordingly.",5,I'll be using the SROI tool starting in August/September on one current project and we'll be then using it on two further contracts we have signed to deliver eCourses for WA Government.,5,"As above re: feedback, overall it was positive with this team there were just a few gaps in the process.",yes,yes,yes

Why not - some elements which do not appear as 'considered' or possibly not as well justified in the context of Thriving.

","We really enjoyed working with the group but there was certain aspects that made this experience less valuable than semester 1s. I am sharing in hope this is useful and I think I may need to give more clarity in the research points. 

I think diving a little deeper into aspects would have made this higher quality. For example one of the points was an in-depth insight into the corporate gifting market, but this section was pulled from a newspaper article we had read. I think using university databases for this would have been more insightful and numerous resources. I also emphasized that with gifting we were focusing on brides gifting to the bridesmaids and groomsmen and not gifts to the married couple. Despite this the report focused on gifting to the married couple which was irrelevant for our company.

I gave a harsh score for usefulness and relevance of the recommendations and this was because we had a deadline of a very big application. The 180 consultants findings in the mid way report would be used for this. We received it in time, but because it was unreferenced we couldn't use any of it for this report.

Without 180 Degrees Consulting, ARF's efforts to make these improvements during this difficult time would have been put on hold and stalled any progress forward.","The only improvement would have been more information on the integrations for the team's CRM recommendations (positive/negative feedback from users, cost, etc.). We currently use Raiser's Edge for our donors and we do not plan to move away from this, so we will need to know how another CRM software for donations forms and/or email will integrate with this platform.",5,"The research, recommendations, and best practices presented will help ARF make immediate improvements, as well as larger, sweeping changes in the coming fiscal year to save money and improve efficiency. ",5,The team obviously put a lot of hard work into this project. Their presentation was well rehearsed and smooth. The fresh perspective and independent insights we gained will drive significant improvements to our website and email communications.

The amount they achieved in such a short time and with such passion is a true credit and inspiration.","If I had been able to meet the students at the start of the project and if they could have visited the pop-up shop, I believe this would have helped with the few recommendations that may not be quite as useful!",5,The majority of the recommendations are excellent and I've already written a plan to implement the recommendations in the coming months with some of the more immediate/easier recommendations already in place!,5,"Brilliant- a truly professional service with amazing attention to detail. The research that the students have undertaken is incredibly similar to the research that I did at the start of the business, but as a one woman machine, no longer have time to do.

The biggest hold-up over the projects has been the provision of data and customer contacts and I think if it was in the scope doc then the client would have this in mind to start preparing so the team isn't held up waiting on them.
